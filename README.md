# Software Test Automation and Quality Assurance<br>
Testing is critical to discovers defects and bugs before the release of a program, which guarantees the quality of the product. It makes the software more reliable and easy to use. Thoroughly tested software ensures reliable and high-performance software operation.<br><br>
## What I learned<br>
**1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**<br>
I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure through extensive testing. This Java program showcases testing techniques I utilized. I specifically used static, JUnit, and experience testing techniques on this project.<br><br>
**2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**<br>
The user’s needs are interpreted by first having a good understanding of the client’s needs. Understanding how the client expects this this program to perform, I can optimize it to fit the expected user needs. For this specific program, the client requested the ability to save appointment, contact, and task objects that are created by the user. I was able to optimize this by providing efficient code that provides excellent feedback through error messages. This was all verified through program testing.<br><br>
**3. How do I approach designing software?**<br>
I take a structured approach to designing software. I start by reviewing the client’s material related to program needs. Next, I create pseudocode to reflect the needs of the client. Finally, I will write the program based on the pseudocode created. Throughout this process I perform testing techniques to verify the program is behaving appropriately.
